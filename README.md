Pure X11
========

This library is now on Rubygems.org as "pure-X11" as I (vidarh) has not had a
response from the original author. If that should change, I'll be happy to
upstread everything.

(under-development) Pure Ruby implementation of the X Window System Protocol.
This library is based off of Mathieu Bouchard's work on his RubyX11 project,
and Richard Ramsdens excellent start on Ruby-X11.

Contributors
------------

There is still quite a bit of work to do on this repository. If you're thinking
about contributing you may want to look over the PDF in the docs folder which documents
the X Window System Protocol.
